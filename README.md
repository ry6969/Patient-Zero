## ‧₊˚ ┊ Overview
NotesDump is a console-based Java application allowing users to manage note entries directly through the terminal.
<br/><br/>
It demonstrates the practical use of Object-oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, alongside proper file handling and modular design.
<br/>
### Users can:
✏️ Add a new entry<br/>
📔 View all entries<br/>
✍🏻 Modify or delete specific entries<br/>
📑 Insert an entry at a certain index

### Note Entry Storage
💾 All entries are stored in a plain text file.

## ‧₊˚ ┊ Project Structure
```
📂 src/
└── 📂 diaryapp/
    ├── ☕ Main.java          
    ├── ☕ Diary.java
    └── ☕ FileHandler.java
```
- `Main.java` - Entry point of the program, containing the menu and handles user interactions.
- `Diary.java` - Handles the diary operations (CRUD)
- `FileHandler.java` - Handles file creation, reading, writing, and appending.
### How to Run the Program
Open your terminal in the `src/` folder and run:
```
javac diaryapp/*.java
```
Run the program using:
```
java diaryapp.Main
```
## ‧₊˚ ┊ Features
1. **Add Entry.** Create a new diary entry with timestamp.
2. **View Entries.** Display all saved entries with numbering.
3. **Modify Entry.** Edit any existing note by selecting its number
4. **Delete Entry.** Remove a specific entry permanently.
5. **Insert Entry.** Add a note at any position in the list.

## ‧₊˚ ┊ Object-oriented Principles
### 💊 Encapsulation
Encapsulation was applied through class design and private fields. For instance, in `Diary`, the `filepath` variable is private and can only be accessed through the class's own methods such as, `addEntry()`, `viewEntries()`, etc.

This ensures that data and operations on it are bundled together and protected from unauthorized modification.

### 💡 Abstraction
Abstraction was implemented when the `FileHandler` class abstracts file operations like reading, writing, and appending. The `Diary` class doesn't need to know how file handling works, for it just calls methods like `FileHandler.appendLine()` or `FileHandler.readAllLines()`.

This hides low-level complexity and keeps the main logic clean.

### 🧬 Inheritance
Inheritance was not heavily used in the program, however, its structure is ready for extension.
For instance, if a subclass like for diary is to be created, it could inherit from `Diary` and override some methods like `addEntry()` and `viewEntries()`.

This shows potential for code reuse and expansion without rewriting existing logic.

### 🎭 Polymorphism
The `switch` expression in `Main.java` demonstrates method-level polymorphism, the same action (`diary.[action]`) calls different behaviors depending on user choice.

Also, if a subclass of `Diary` overrides a method, for instance `addEntry()`, the program could dynamically call the correct version at runtime, enabling flexible behavior.

## ‧₊˚ ┊ Example Output
